# Higher-Lower
HIGHER OR LOWER GAME
In this game, you compare the follower counts of two popular accounts and try to guess which one has more followers. With each correct guess, your score increases, and the game continues until you make a wrong guess.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.Random Accounts: Two random accounts are selected for comparison, each with a name, description, country, and follower count.
2.Player Guess: The player is prompted to guess which account has more followers by choosing 'A' or 'B'.
3.Answer Checking: The game compares the follower counts of the two accounts and checks if the player's guess is correct.
4.Score Tracking: The player's score increases with each correct guess and is displayed after each round.
5.Game End: The game continues until the player guesses incorrectly, after which the final score is shown.

FEATURES:
-Random Accounts: Each round, two random accounts are displayed, and you have to guess which one has more followers.
-Score Tracking: Your score is updated with each correct guess, and the game continues until you get one wrong.
-Fun Visuals: The game includes visually appealing logos and a "vs" separator between the two accounts for a more engaging experience.
